I added a role field by making an abstract user. The field will contain the user's role if he is a user or a driver. In the Request table I added an email_driver field to allow the user to choose who they send a request to. You will therefore check if the email entered by the user is associated with an existing user and that the user in question is a driver. In the case it is a driver you send the request. Since the request is already created, the driver will only update it by entering a new value in the status field. I just updated the status field and registered the user who made the update, he is our driver.
I hope my code was useful to you.
